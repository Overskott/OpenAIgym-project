# OpenAIgym project

This repository contains the code for the exam project done through the course ACIT4610 Evolutionary artificial intelligence and robotics, a Master's course at OsloMet fall 2022. It shows that a 1-dimensional cellular automaton and a simple neural network can be trained by evolutionary algorithms to solve the cart in the pole-cart problem.

The project report can be found  [here](https://github.com/Overskott/OpenAIgym-project/blob/main/ACIT4610_report.pdf).
